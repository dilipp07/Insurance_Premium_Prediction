<h1>Welcome TO Insurance Premium Prediction</h1>

<p>The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on
    their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health
    insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our
    study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an
    insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.</p>
